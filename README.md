# php_reverse_shell_windows
Simple barely functional php native reverse shell for windows.

## Basics
The only thing that makes this shell windows is the cmd.exe execution, change as needed.

Because of the minimal logic in this shell, the reads and writes step on each other, so you might need to give it some extra characters on input to trigger more output.
